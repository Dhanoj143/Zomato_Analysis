# Zomato_Analysis

The Zomato Sales Analysis project provides a comprehensive view of sales and customer behavior, enabling data-driven insights into business performance. Using Power BI, the analysis visualizes various metrics, including total sales, order volume, revenue trends, popular menu items, and peak sales hours. Filters and slicers allow for detailed segmentation by location, cuisine type, and customer demographics. By exploring KPIs such as average order value, repeat customer rate, and growth patterns, the dashboard helps identify successful products, understand seasonal demand, and optimize marketing efforts. This project highlights how Power BI can transform raw sales data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
